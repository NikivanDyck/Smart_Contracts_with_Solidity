# Smart_Contracts_with_Solidity
Module 20


## Overview

Solidity is a programming language for implementing smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are agreements that special computer programs, which can run on a blockchain, create. 

In this project, I will set up a local blockchain development environment, create a solidity contract, implement smart functions, and deploy a smart contract in an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

## Technologies Used

* Solidity
* Remix - Ethereum
